# Strapi Users Permissions Export

This is a cli tool to export strapi role permissions to a json file.
Also, it can import the json file to strapi database.

## Usage
Navigate to the root of your strapi project and run the following command:

```bash
npx strapi-users-permissions-export
```

This will show the help and run again with the flags to export your permissions.
